# Changelog

Release notes for Plex Poster Set Helper 2. The Build & Release workflow reads the
section whose heading matches the pushed tag and uses it as the GitHub release body,
so keep each version under its own `## What's new in vX.Y.Z` heading.

## What's new in v2.2.8

### Smoother pagination
The paginated lists in the **Reset Posters** page and the **Creators** browser are cleaner to navigate. Changing pages now snaps the list back to the top and the rows just appear, instead of the old row-by-row slide-in animation. The page controls now sit pinned at the bottom, flanking the floating dock, while the list scrolls cleanly underneath both, so the pager is always in reach without hiding your content.

### Readable Settings hints
The small helper text under each Settings field (like the TMDB API key note) was too dark and too small to read comfortably. It's now a lighter, slightly larger style.

## What's new in v2.2.7

### Cleaner Current Plex Art
The **Current Plex Art** strip no longer floods with unrelated posters. If a movie belonged to a large or smart collection - the kind Kometa builds, like "Trending Movies", "Top Pirated Movies", or "Metacritic Must See" - the strip used to pull in every member of those collections, burying the movie's own art under dozens of unrelated titles. It now shows only genuine franchise collections (Toy Story, Harry Potter) with their sibling movies and skips those organizational buckets entirely.

### Smoother Library Browser
Resizing, opening, and closing the Sets panel no longer shuffles and squishes the library thumbnails. The grid now snaps cleanly to its new width in one step instead of reflowing every frame, dragging the panel edge tracks the cursor without stutter, and the last poster column keeps a proper gap from the panel instead of tucking underneath it.

### Paginated Reset Posters
The **Reset Posters** list is now paginated (20 rows at a time) instead of rendering your entire applied-poster history at once, so large histories stay fast and smooth. This also fixes a bug where a long list would squish every row down to an unreadable sliver instead of scrolling.

## What's new in v2.2.6

### Fixed applying MediUX sets to movies and shows in the Library Browser
Applying a MediUX set to a movie or show from the Library Browser failed silently. The Apply button now correctly uploads the set's posters, backdrops, and title cards to the selected title. Collections were unaffected.

### Faster creator browsing with real pagination
Opening a MediUX creator no longer blocks on a full catalog crawl before showing anything. Sets now stream in as they are found, and the browser is **paginated** - only one page renders at a time, so even creators with thousands of sets stay fast and responsive instead of choking on one endless list. The crawl runs in the background, so you can switch creators or leave the Library Browser and come back to find it further along.

Creators are now **cached on disk** between launches: reopening one you've viewed before shows instantly with no loading spinner, and instead of re-scraping the whole catalog the app does a quick incremental check that only fetches genuinely new sets and stops as soon as it reaches ones you already have. Loading also no longer floods the log.

### Sort your library
The Library Browser grid has a new sort control: order any library (or your collections) by **Recently Added**, **Title**, **Release Year**, or **Last Played**, with a button to flip between ascending and descending. Your choice is remembered.

## What's new in v2.2.5

### Show or hide collections
A new **Collections** toggle under Settings → Libraries lets you hide Plex collections from the Library Browser (the Collections tab and collection results in search), the same way you include or exclude a library. It's on by default.

### Clearer in-app Docker update guide
The "Update your container" dialog is now organized into tabs by method (unraid, Docker Compose, run script) and opens to the one that best matches your system, showing the run-script command for your OS. The Docker guide documents the Compose update path too.

### Security hardening
An internal CodeQL pass: least-privilege permissions on the CI and release workflows, linear (non-backtracking) parsing of collection titles, and hostname-based URL matching in the scraper.

## What's new in v2.2.4

### Faster collection art in the Library Browser
Finding MediUX sets for a Plex collection is noticeably quicker. The member TMDB lookups and the per-set metadata fetches now run in parallel instead of one after another, and sets that were already scanned aren't re-fetched on the fallback passes.

### Browse current Plex art in a lightbox
The **Current Plex Art** strip is now clickable. Open any poster, season, or collection image full-screen and arrow through them with the same lightbox used elsewhere in the Library Browser.

### Docker: web UI only
The legacy headless scheduler container has been removed. The web UI already includes a built-in scheduler and is now the single supported container, so the Compose file, `run.sh` / `run.ps1` launchers, and unraid template are trimmed to match. The image no longer requests a 1 GB shared-memory bump (Chromium runs with `--disable-dev-shm-usage`, so the default is enough). Existing `/config` volumes carry over unchanged.

## What's new in v2.2.3

### Docker now ships the native web UI
The Docker image now builds and serves the native web UI on port `3939` instead of the old KasmVNC desktop. Open `http://<host>:3939` in your browser and sign in with Plex - no VNC client and no separate HTTPS port for clipboard support. The Compose file, `run.sh` / `run.ps1` launchers, and unraid template are all updated to the single 3939 port, and existing `/config` volumes carry over unchanged.

Thanks to @SanchoBlaze for the web UI Docker work.

## What's new in v2.2.2

### Windows desktop startup fixes
Packaged Windows builds no longer crash on launch (`electron-store` was ESM-only and incompatible with the packaged main process). Config now lives in `config.json` under your app data folder, with automatic migration from the old store file.

First-run Chromium setup, window visibility, and tray behaviour are more reliable on Windows. Startup diagnostics are written to `boot.log` in app data (or `%TEMP%\plex-poster-helper-boot.log`).

If the app seems to flash and quit, check Task Manager for leftover **Plex Poster Set Helper 2** processes from a previous run and end them before launching again.

## What's new in v2.2.0

### Plex collection posters
The Library Browser now has a **Collections** tab. Browse your Plex collections, discover matching MediUX sets, and apply a collection poster plus member movie posters in one go. Choose whether to update just the collection art, the child movies, or both.

### Current Plex Art strip
When you select a movie, show, or collection, a **Current Plex Art** row shows what's on Plex right now (poster, background, season art) so you can compare before applying a set.

### Library Browser layout
- Wider, resizable Sets panel (drag the left edge; width is remembered)
- Fluid layout that scales set previews and thumbnails with panel size
- MediUX set lists are cached for 30 minutes with a manual refresh button

### Docker / web mode
The Docker image now serves the app as a native web UI (no VNC desktop). Sign in with Plex to access the app in your browser.

## What's new in v2.1.2

### Anime (HAMA) now matches MediUX automatically
Anime libraries using the **HAMA** agent tag titles with an AniDB ID, which TMDB can't look up directly. The Library Browser would show "No TMDB match" and tell you to add a TMDB key, even when one was already set, and a key wouldn't have helped anyway. The app now converts AniDB IDs to TMDB automatically using the open-source [Fribb/anime-lists](https://github.com/Fribb/anime-lists) dataset (cached locally, downloaded once and refreshed weekly), so HAMA anime resolves and finds its MediUX sets, no TMDB key required. HAMA's IMDb-style IDs are recognized too.

### Clearer "no match" message
When an item genuinely can't be matched, the notice no longer tells you to add a TMDB key you already have. It now only suggests a key when one would actually help, and otherwise explains that the title's ID has no known TMDB mapping.

## What's new in v2.1.1

### Scheduled jobs now show poster previews in Reset Posters
Posters applied by a scheduled job were landing in the Reset Posters list with a blank placeholder instead of a thumbnail. Scheduled runs now record the poster preview (and the exact applied image URLs) just like a manual apply, so those items show their artwork and light up the "in library" markers. Items applied by earlier scheduled runs stay blank until the job runs again.

### Reset All keeps its progress when you leave the page
Starting a **Reset All** and navigating away no longer loses track of what's resetting. The reset now runs above the page, so leaving and coming back shows the live "Resetting… N/M" progress and each item's status, matching what the log already reported. Single resets survive navigation too.

## What's new in v2.1.0

### Reset Posters: free up space on your Plex server
The Reset Posters page can now delete the custom poster and background images this tool uploaded, not just switch the artwork back. Turn on **Delete uploaded images** and a reset also removes those uploaded files from your Plex server, then hit the new **Clean Bundles** button to reclaim the disk space right away instead of waiting on Plex's weekly maintenance.
- Clean Bundles tracks the real task and finishes exactly when Plex does, with no fixed wait.
- It stays available even after you've cleared every tracked poster.

### Reset Posters redesign
- Items now drop off the list on their own once reset, so there's no more hitting Refresh to see what's left.
- Source-colored rows (MediUX / ThePosterDB), larger poster thumbnails, and loading skeletons.
- With delete armed, the page and each row's button clearly warn before anything is removed.

### Sharper collection-set matching (MediUX)
Backdrops and title cards inside a MediUX collection set now route to the exact movie they belong to and match your library by **TMDB id**, recovering that id from the set's poster for the same movie. Fewer collection backdrops landing on the wrong item or going missing.

### Redesigned Browser Engine settings
The Chromium engine card got a fresh look: a little browser-window emblem with a live status light, the detected Chromium **build number**, and one-click **copy** for the executable path.

### Clearer Title Mappings guidance
When a TMDB API key is set, the Title Mappings page now confirms in green that the section is usually unnecessary (your library matches by id) while still letting you add a mapping as a fallback for the rare title that won't match on its own.

### Polish
- Reordered the dock so **Manual Import** sits before **Title Mappings**.
- Small layout fixes on the Library and Scheduler pages.

## What's new in v2.0.24

### Smarter matching for manual scrapes and bulk lists
Pasted MediUX links and saved bulk lists now match your library by **TMDB id** - the same exact matching the Library Browser uses - instead of guessing by title and year. That means fewer "not in library" misses and wrong-title applies, especially for TVDB/IMDb-agent libraries (such as anime via HAMA).

### Collection sets apply to the whole collection by default
Applying a MediUX collection set now spreads across every movie in the collection that's in your library, plus the collection poster, right out of the box. The per-set toggle still lets you narrow it back to just the title you're viewing.

### Redesigned manual import
- A cleaner tabbed header (**Scrape URLs** / **Bulk Files**) with a sliding indicator.
- A themed paste box - the stray white resize grip and chunky native scrollbar are gone.
- Quick **Browse** buttons open ThePosterDB and MediUX in your browser, right where you paste links.

### In-app Docker update guide
Docker and unraid builds can't self-update, and the container has no desktop to open a link on. The update notice now opens an in-app guide with copy-ready **pull, rebuild, restart** commands for unraid, Windows, Mac/Linux, and Compose.

### Now on unraid Community Applications
Install it straight from the unraid **Apps** tab - search _Plex Poster Helper_. It pulls the prebuilt Docker Hub image and gives you a WebUI button, no commands needed.

## What's new in v2.0.23

### Redesigned navigation: bottom dock
The left sidebar is gone, replaced by a floating dock at the bottom of the window. Navigation stays out of the way, pages get the full width, and the whole layout feels cleaner and more focused.

### Instant search (Ctrl/Cmd+F)
A new command palette puts everything a keystroke away. Press **Ctrl+F** (**Cmd+F** on macOS) from anywhere to:
- Jump straight to any page or Settings section
- Find a movie or show across all your libraries and open its MediUX sets
- Open a MediUX creator
No more hunting through menus.

### Smarter TMDB ID matching (optional API key)
Library matching now prefers exact TMDB IDs instead of guessing by title and year. Add a free TMDB v3 API key in **Settings** and the tool will:
- Match titles by ID, fixing most matching and title-mapping issues automatically
- Resolve TVDB/IMDb-agent libraries (such as anime via HAMA) to the correct TMDB entries

The key is optional. Without it, matching falls back to title and year as before.
