## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Plex Media Server with API access

### Setup

1. **Clone or download this repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tonywied17/plex-poster-set-helper.git
   cd plex-poster-set-helper
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure your Plex connection**
   
   Rename `example_config.json` to `config.json` and fill in your details:

   ```json
   {
     "base_url": "http://192.168.1.100:32400",
     "token": "your_plex_token_here",
     "movie_library": "Movies",
     "tv_library": "TV Shows",
     "bulk_files": ["bulk_import.txt"],
     "mediux_filters": ["poster", "backdrop", "title_card"],
     "title_mappings": {
       "Pluribus": "PLUR1BUS",
       "The Office": "The Office (US)"
     }
   }
   ```

   **Configuration Options:**
   
   | Option | Description | Example |
   |--------|-------------|---------|
   | `base_url` | Your Plex server URL and port | `"http://192.168.1.100:32400"` |
   | `token` | Plex authentication token ([How to find](https://support.plex.tv/articles/204059436-finding-an-authentication-token-x-plex-token/)) | `"aBc123XyZ..."` |
   | `movie_library` | Name of your Movies library | `"Movies"` or `["Movies", "4K Movies"]` |
   | `tv_library` | Name of your TV Shows library | `"TV Shows"` or `["TV", "Anime"]` |
   | `bulk_files` | List of bulk import text files | `["bulk_import.txt", "movies.txt"]` |
   | `mediux_filters` | MediUX media types to download | `["poster", "backdrop", "title_card"]` |

## Supported URLs

### ThePosterDB

| URL Type | Example | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| **Set** | `https://theposterdb.com/set/12345` | Downloads all posters in a set |
| **Single Poster** | `https://theposterdb.com/poster/66055` | Finds and downloads the entire set from a single poster |
| **User Profile** | `https://theposterdb.com/user/username` | Downloads all uploads from a user |

### MediUX

| URL Type | Example | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| **Set** | `https://mediux.pro/sets/24522` | Downloads all posters in a set with original quality |

> **Note:** MediUX downloads use direct API URLs for maximum image quality (~2MB originals instead of ~116KB compressed versions).

## Advanced Features

### Concurrent Processing

The tool supports parallel processing of multiple URLs simultaneously, dramatically improving import speed:

- **Configurable Workers:** Set worker count from 1 to your CPU core count (default: 3)
- **Visual Feedback:** Color-coded borders show processing status:
  - **Orange border** - Currently being processed
  - **Green border** - Successfully completed
  - **Red border** - Error occurred
- **Progress Tracking:** Real-time display of active workers and completion status
- **Cancel Anytime:** Stop operations mid-process with the Cancel button

**Performance Example:**
- Single-threaded: 9 URLs ≈ 90 seconds
- 3 workers: 9 URLs ≈ 30 seconds
- Maximum throughput with CPU-based worker scaling

### Bulk Import

Create a text file with one URL per line:

```text
# Movies
https://theposterdb.com/set/12345
https://mediux.pro/sets/24522

// TV Shows
https://theposterdb.com/set/67890
https://theposterdb.com/poster/11111
```

Lines starting with `#` or `//` are treated as comments and ignored.

**Run bulk import:**
```bash
python main.py bulk my_posters.txt
```

Or use the default file specified in `config.json`:
```bash
python main.py bulk
```

**Multiple Bulk Files:**
The GUI supports managing multiple bulk import files through a dropdown selector:
- Create new bulk files with the "New File" button
- Add existing .txt files (automatically detected and loaded)
- Switch between files without losing unsaved changes
- Delete files you no longer need (minimum 1 file retained)
- All files are tracked in `config.json` under `bulk_files` array
- Protection against accidentally overwriting existing files

### MediUX Filters

Control which types of media are downloaded from MediUX by editing the `mediux_filters` in `config.json`:

```json
"mediux_filters": ["poster", "backdrop", "title_card"]
```

**Available filters:**
- `poster` - Standard movie/show posters and season covers
- `backdrop` - Background/backdrop images  
- `title_card` - Episode title cards
- `season_cover` - Season-specific cover art
- `show_cover` - Show-level cover art
- `background` - Alternative background images

Remove any filter to skip that media type during import.

### Title Matching

The tool uses intelligent matching to find media in your Plex library:

**1. Manual Title Mappings** (Exact overrides)
For cases where poster source names don't match your Plex library, use `title_mappings` in `config.json`:

```json
"title_mappings": {
  "Pluribus": "PLUR1BUS",
  "The Office": "The Office (US)",
  "Star Wars Episode IV": "Star Wars"
}
```

When the scraper finds "Pluribus", it will automatically look for "PLUR1BUS" in your library.

**2. Fuzzy Matching** (Automatic fallback)
If exact matching fails, the tool automatically tries fuzzy matching with 80% similarity:
- "The Batman" might match "Batman (2022)"
- "Star Wars: A New Hope" might match "Star Wars Episode IV"

The tool will notify you when fuzzy matching is used: `ℹ Fuzzy matched 'Title A' to 'Title B'`

### Multiple Libraries

Apply posters to multiple Plex libraries simultaneously:

```json
{
  "movie_library": ["Movies", "4K Movies", "Kids Movies"],
  "tv_library": ["TV Shows", "Anime", "Kids TV"]
}
```

The tool will find and update the same media across all specified libraries.

## Building the Executable

A pre-built Windows executable is available in the `dist/` folder. To build it yourself:

1. **Install PyInstaller**
   ```bash
   pip install pyinstaller
   ```

2. **Build using the spec file**
   ```bash
   pyinstaller _PlexPosterSetHelper.spec
   ```

> **Tip:** Set `interactive_cli = False` in the main script before building to make the executable launch in GUI mode by default.

## Troubleshooting

### "Poster set not found" Error

**Problem:** Error when using ThePosterDB single poster URLs  
**Solution:** This has been fixed in the latest version. The scraper now properly handles the updated page structure where set links are in tooltip elements.

### MediUX Images Not Downloading

**Problem:** Images appear blank or fail to download  
**Solution:** The scraper now uses direct API URLs (`https://api.mediux.pro/assets/`) instead of the Next.js proxy. Ensure you have network access to this domain.

### Posters Not Applying to Plex

**Problem:** Tool downloads posters but they don't appear in Plex  
**Solutions:**
- Verify library names in `config.json` match exactly (case-sensitive)
- Ensure media exists in Plex with matching titles and years
- Check that your Plex token has write permissions
- Confirm the Plex server is accessible at the configured URL

### Connection Errors

**Problem:** Cannot connect to scraping sources  
**Solutions:**
- Check your internet connection
- Ensure Playwright browser is properly installed: `playwright install chromium`
- Some networks may block automated access; try from a different network
- Check if the source website is accessible in your browser

### Operations Not Stopping

**Problem:** Cancel button doesn't immediately stop processing  
**Solution:** The cancel operation stops accepting new tasks and cancels pending futures, but currently running tasks must complete. This is expected behavior with ThreadPoolExecutor. Close the application window for immediate termination with proper cleanup.

### GUI Performance Issues

**Problem:** GUI becomes unresponsive during large imports  
**Solutions:**
- Reduce worker count to 1-2 for system with limited resources
- Process URLs in smaller batches
- Close other resource-intensive applications
- The progress indicators and cancel button should remain responsive during normal operation

### Media Not Found in Library

**Problem:** Tool reports media not found even though it exists  
**Solutions:**
- Verify the media title and year match between the poster source and Plex
- Check for special characters or formatting differences
- Ensure the media is properly scanned and visible in your Plex library
- Try refreshing metadata in Plex before running the tool
